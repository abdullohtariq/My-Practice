sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
reversed5000  = 5 sec
Sorted50000   = 0.6sec
random50000   = 5sec
The Big O is Big But the smaller bound implies that it is
bubble sort cause in case of lower bound the time dropped very much



sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
Reversed50000 = 0.6sec
Sorted50000   = 0.6sec
random50000   = 0.6sec
Which means that it is same in worst case and best case
(We Know with this time Frame that it is faster than the both)
Above Two Points Conclude That it is infact Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
reversed5000  = 2 sec
Sorted50000   = 2 sec
random50000   = 2 sec
The remaining one is ofc selection but we can aslo tell by:
It is same in upperbound and lower bound
